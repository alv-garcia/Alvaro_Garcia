<h1>A humanidade e sua responsabilidade</h1>
<p>O 6º relatório de mudanças climáticas do IPCC aponta o papel inequívoco das atividades humanas no aquecimento global. A certeza em relação a responsabilidade da humanidade no processo das mudanças climáticas evoluiu a cada relatório, assim como os cenários e números que apontam um desafio cada vez maior para a sociedade na mitigação e adaptação a esse futuro.</p>

<p>Buscando explorar as evidências atuais deste fenômeno e o papel dos diferentes países e setores econômicos, construí uma série de visualizações que ajudam a compreender melhor o contexto e panorama deste desafio. As visualizações foram desenvolvidas na linguagem de programação R fazendo uso de seu rico ecossistema de pacotes que expandem suas funcionalidades básicas, notadamente o GGPLOT2 e PLOTLY.</p>
