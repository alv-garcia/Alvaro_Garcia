<h1>A humanidade e sua responsabilidade</h1>
<p>O 6º relatório de mudanças climáticas do IPCC aponta o papel inequívoco das atividades humanas no aquecimento global. A certeza em relação a responsabilidade da humanidade no processo das mudanças climáticas evoluiu a cada relatório, assim como os cenários e números que apontam um desafio cada vez maior para a sociedade na mitigação e adaptação a esse futuro.</p>

<p>Buscando explorar as evidências atuais deste fenômeno e o papel dos diferentes países e setores econômicos, construí uma série de visualizações que ajudam a compreender melhor o contexto e panorama deste desafio. As visualizações foram desenvolvidas na linguagem de programação R fazendo uso de seu rico ecossistema de pacotes que expandem suas funcionalidades básicas, notadamente o GGPLOT2 e PLOTLY.</p>

<p>O aquecimento global se refere ao aumento da <strong>temperatura média global</strong>. Essa variação fora do padrão climático por conta das atividades antrópicas pode ser observado na figura 1 que mostra a anomalia da temperatura do padrão (Baseline) utilizado pela NASA. O aumento, que pode ser observado ao longo de todo o período de análise, é ainda mais alarmante nas <strong>últimas décadas do século XIX e iniciais do século XX.</strong></p>

<p>Conforme apontado pelo Sexto relatório do IPCC, <strong>o papel antrópico</strong> na emissão de gases do efeito estufa é um fator inequívoco para as mudanças climáticas. As principais fontes antrópicas desses gases estão associadas a <strong>queima de combustíveis fósseis</strong>, processos industriais, uso do solo e mudança no uso do solo. <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>O aumento significativo observado nas emissões de CO2 em dois séculos, passando de <strong>3 bilhões de toneladas</strong> no início da série histórica para <strong>mais de 30 bilhões</strong>, apresenta a evolução do papel da humanidade no processo de aquecimento do planeta. Esse processo que se intensificou no século XX, foi alavancado pelos países desenvolvidos e altamente industrializados. Conforme apresentado na figura 2, o total de emissões associados a cada região do globo apresentou características muito distintas. Embora a Europa e América do Norte tenham sido históricamente grandes emissores, na virada do século XX, a Ásia alcançou o papel mais relevante no cenário global.</p>

<p>O Setor de geração de energia e aquecimento é historicamente o maior emissor de gases do efeito estufa da economia mundial, representado <strong>cerca de 30% das emissões mundiais.</strong> O setor de Transporte é o segundo mais importante, sendo em responsável em 2020 por 7,28 Bilhões de t CO2e, aproximadamente <strong>15 % das emissões globais</strong>. A agricultura e o setor de construções estão em seguida no ranking de contribuição das emissões globais, com <strong>papéis muito próximos</strong> dentro do cenátio mundial.</p>

<p>O Sexto Relatório de Avaliação do IPCC deixa claro: a influência humana no aquecimento global é inequívoca e suas consequências já estão sendo sentidas em todo o planeta. A cada novo relatório, a ciência se torna mais robusta e as projeções, mais alarmantes.</p>
<p>O tempo para agir é agora. Limitar o aquecimento global a 1.5°C, como estabelecido no Acordo de Paris, exige um esforço global sem precedentes. Precisamos reduzir drasticamente as emissões de gases de efeito estufa nos próximos anos, investir em fontes de energia renovável e desenvolver tecnologias inovadoras para mitigar e nos adaptarmos às mudanças climáticas.</p>
<p>Os dados apresentados neste blog são apenas um vislumbre da complexa realidade que enfrentamos. É fundamental que continuemos a explorar e aprofundar nosso conhecimento sobre as mudanças climáticas para que possamos tomar decisões mais conscientes e eficazes.</p>
